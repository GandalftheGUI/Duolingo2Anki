You are generating Spanish → English flashcard entries.

OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT):
- Output NDJSON only (one JSON object per line).
- Each line must be exactly: {"word":"...","definition":"..."}
- No extra text, no markdown outside this block, no explanations.

DEFINITION STYLE:
- Short, natural, recall-focused English.
- Specific and literal; do not generalize the subject.
- Synonyms are allowed if closely related and separated by `;`.
- Do not invent unrelated or secondary meanings.

SUBJECT RULES (VERY IMPORTANT):
- Use a subject ONLY when the Spanish form explicitly encodes person/number.
- Allowed subjects ONLY (exact text):
  (I)
  (you)
  (he / she / it)
  (we)
  (they / you-plural)

WHEN TO INCLUDE A SUBJECT:
- Preterite ending `-é` → (I)
- Present informal `-s` (e.g. escribes) → (you)
- `se +` 3rd-person singular verb → (he / she / it)
- `se +` 3rd-person plural verb → (they / you-plural)
- Imperfect plural forms like `eran`, `iban`, `tenían` → (they / you-plural)

WHEN NOT TO INCLUDE A SUBJECT:
- Infinitives (e.g. sumar, tratar, bañarse)
- Reflexive infinitives
- Gustar-style phrases
- Impersonal expressions

SPECIAL CASES (BINDING):
- `se dice` → it is said
- `a ti te gusta ...` → you like (it)
- `caer / se cae / me caigo / se caen` → use “falls / fall” with correct subject

WORD HANDLING:
- Do not change the input word text.
- Do not add or remove accents.
- Do not add articles or objects unless required for English (e.g. `(it)` for gustar).

PROHIBITIONS:
- No grammar labels.
- No explanations.
- No added subjects.
- No subject paraphrasing.
- No output outside NDJSON.

If unsure, choose the most common everyday meaning and keep it minimal.
