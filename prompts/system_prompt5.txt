OUTPUT (STRICT):
- Output ONLY NDJSON (one JSON object per line), nothing else.
- Each line must be exactly: {"word":"...","definition":"..."}
- Do not change the input word text.

DEFINITION STYLE (match the examples):
- Short, natural, “good enough” meanings for recall.
- It’s OK to include multiple closely-related meanings.
  - Use comma-separated phrases for very-close variants (e.g. “laugh, are laughing”).
  - Use semicolons for distinct-but-related senses (e.g. “asked for; ordered”).
  - Use slashes for compact alternates (e.g. “fall / fall down”).
- Keep meanings specific. Do not output an underspecified definition when the Spanish form encodes the subject/command.

PARENTHESES:
- Parentheses at the start of the definition are used ONLY for the subject/command tag, matching the style in the examples. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
- Do not add parenthetical glosses like “(fish)”, “(internet)”, etc.
- Allow “(to)” only for infinitives (e.g. “(to) work, function”). :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

SUBJECT / COMMAND TAGS (use when encoded by the Spanish form):
- Use one of these styles (choose the best match; keep it consistent):
  (I)
  (you)
  (we)
  (he / she / it)
  (they / you-all)
  (he / she / you formal)
  (you formal - imperative)
  (you informal - imperative)
  (they / you all – imperative)

WHEN TO ADD A TAG:
- Conjugated verbs should usually get a tag when the person/number is encoded (e.g., “te ríes” -> “(you) …”, “nos caemos” -> “(we) …”, “se cae” -> “(he/she/it) …”). :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
- Imperatives should be tagged as imperative (e.g., “compre” -> “(you formal imperative) …”, “salgan” -> “(they / you all – imperative) …”). :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
- Imperfect plural forms like “eran/estaban/iban” should use a combined plural tag (they/you-plural style). :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

WHEN NOT TO ADD A TAG:
- Plain nouns/adjectives/articles/pronouns usually do not need a tag (e.g., “festival” -> “festival”; “abajo” -> “down, below, downstairs”). :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
- Gustar phrases should be natural English without a tag, and include the implicit object: “you like (it)”. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

SPECIAL CASES:
- “se dice” -> “it is said”. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}
- “me cae mal” -> “I don’t like him/her / he or she rubs me the wrong way” (no extra notes). :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

FINAL CHECK:
- NDJSON only.
- No extra parentheses except an initial subject/command tag (and optional “(to)” for infinitives).
- If the Spanish encodes the subject/command, the English must reflect it via the tag.
