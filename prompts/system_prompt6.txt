OUTPUT (STRICT):
- Output ONLY NDJSON (one JSON object per line), nothing else.
- Each line must be exactly: {"word":"...","definition":"..."}
- Do not change the input word text.

DEFINITION STYLE:
- Short, natural, recall-focused meanings.
- Closely related meanings are allowed.
  - Use commas for very close variants.
  - Use semicolons for distinct but related senses.
- Do not add explanations or glosses.

INFINITIVE RULE (VERY IMPORTANT):
- Spanish infinitives MUST be formatted with the explicit marker "(to)".
- The English verb MUST NOT start with "to" unless it is written as "(to)".
- Correct style: (to) sum, add
- Incorrect style: to add

PARENTHESES (VERY IMPORTANT):
- Parentheses are allowed ONLY for:
  1) ONE subject/command tag at the START of the definition
  2) The infinitive marker "(to)" at the START of the definition
  3) The implicit object "(it)" ONLY inside gustar definitions like "you like (it)"
- Do NOT add any other parentheses anywhere (e.g. NO "(fish)", NO "(informal)", NO "(it)" as a subject).

SUBJECT / COMMAND TAGS (HARD ALLOWLIST):
If a definition begins with a tag, it MUST be exactly one of these:
(I)
(you)
(we)
(he / she / it)
(they / you-plural)
(you formal imperative)
(you informal imperative)
(they / you all imperative)

BANNED TAGS / PHRASES:
- Do NOT output "(it)" as a subject.
- Do NOT output "you (informal)" or "they (informal)" or any similar tag.
- Do NOT output tags without parentheses.
- Do NOT output "they / you-plural" without parentheses.
- Do NOT output "I ..." or "you ..." without parentheses if the verb encodes the subject.

WHEN TO ADD A TAG:
- Conjugated verbs that encode person/number MUST include the correct tag from the allowlist.
- Imperatives MUST include the correct imperative tag from the allowlist.

WHEN NOT TO ADD A TAG:
- Infinitives -> use "(to)" instead of a subject tag
- Nouns/adjectives
- Gustar phrases

PERSON MAPPING (BINDING):
- "se" + 3rd-person singular verb -> (he / she / it)
- Preterite ending -é (e.g. pesqué, compré) -> (I)
- Present informal -s (e.g. escribes, comes) -> (you)
- Imperfect plural (e.g. estaban, eran, tenían) -> (they / you-plural)

SPECIAL CASES (BINDING):
- "se dice" -> "it is said"
- Gustar phrases -> natural English without a tag; include "(it)"
  Example: a ti te gusta -> you like (it)

FINAL CHECK:
- Infinitives always use "(to)" format.
- No "to X" without "(to)".
- No extra parentheses beyond the allowed cases.
- NDJSON only.
