OUTPUT (STRICT):
- Output ONLY NDJSON (one JSON object per line), nothing else.
- Each line must be exactly:
  {"word":"...","definition":"..."}
- The keys MUST be exactly "word" and "definition".
- The value of "definition" MUST always be a quoted string.
- Never output ">" or any HTML-like tokens.
- Do not change the input word text.

DEFINITION STYLE:
- Short, natural, recall-focused meanings.
- Closely related meanings are allowed.
  - Use commas for very close variants.
  - Use semicolons for distinct but related senses.
- Do not add explanations or glosses.

INFINITIVE RULE (VERY IMPORTANT):
- Spanish infinitives MUST be formatted with the explicit marker "(to)".
- "(to)" MUST appear exactly ONCE at the start of the definition.
- The English verb MUST NOT start with "to" unless written as "(to)".
- Correct style: (to) sum, add
- Incorrect styles:
  - to add
  - (to) add, (to) sum

PARENTHESES (VERY IMPORTANT):
- Parentheses are allowed ONLY for:
  1) ONE subject/command tag at the START of the definition
  2) The infinitive marker "(to)" at the START of the definition
  3) The implicit object "(it)" ONLY inside gustar definitions
- Do NOT add any other parentheses.
- If an object is encoded in the Spanish (e.g. le / lo / la),
  express it as words ("to him / her"), NOT parentheses.

SUBJECT / COMMAND TAGS (HARD ALLOWLIST):
If a definition begins with a tag, it MUST be exactly one of these:
(I)
(you)
(we)
(he / she / it)
(they / you-plural)
(you formal imperative)
(you informal imperative)
(they / you all imperative)

BANNED TAGS / PHRASES:
- Do NOT output "(it)" as a subject.
- Do NOT output "you (informal)", "they (informal)", or similar.
- Do NOT output tags without parentheses.
- Do NOT output bare "it falls", "you write", etc. when a tag is required.

WHEN TO ADD A TAG (MANDATORY):
- Conjugated verbs that encode person/number MUST include a tag.
- Imperatives MUST include a tag.
- Omitting a required tag is an error.

WHEN NOT TO ADD A TAG:
- Infinitives → use "(to)"
- Nouns/adjectives
- Gustar phrases

PERSON MAPPING (BINDING):
- "se" + 3rd-person singular verb → (he / she / it)
- Preterite ending -é → (I)
- Present informal -s → (you)
- Imperfect plural → (they / you-plural)

SPECIAL CASES (BINDING):
- "se dice" → it is said
- Gustar phrases → no tag; include "(it)"
  Example: a ti te gusta → you like (it)

FINAL CHECK:
- Required subject tags must appear.
- "(to)" appears once for infinitives.
- No extra parentheses.
- Valid NDJSON only.
